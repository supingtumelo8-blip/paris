        Paris traces its roots to the Parisii, a Gallic tribe that settled along the Seine long before the city rose to global prominence. Over centuries, monarchs, revolutionaries, artists, and architects have reshaped its skyline, leaving a layered narrative that is visible in Gothic cathedrals, Haussmann boulevards, and daring contemporary structures. Museums like the Louvre and the Muse d'Orsay preserve masterpieces that define artistic epochs, while smaller ateliers continue to push new frontiers.

      <p class="justified">
        Culture here is lived as much as it is displayed. Morning begins with a ritual at the boulangerie, afternoons drift through bookstores and leafy squares, and evenings bring theatre, jazz, and the quiet glow of bistros. Paris speaks with many voices immigrant kitchens, fashion houses, street artists  and it is in this chorus that the city renews itself daily.

        Begin at the Eiffel Tower for sweeping perspectives of the city, then drift to the Arc de Triomphe and descend the Champs-Elysees toward the Tuileries. Cross the Seine for the Muse d'Orsay's Impressionist light, then circle back to the Ile de la Cite to admire Notre-Dame's resilient silhouette. Each landmark is close enough to stitch together on foot, rewarding you with river breezes and impromptu cafe stops.

        For a different viewpoint, climb the steps of Sacre-Coeur in Montmartre, where cobbled lanes reveal artists studios and hidden gardens. Food lovers can explore bustling markets like Marche des Enfants Rouges, while fashion fans browse ateliers in Le Marais. Wherever you turn, Paris invites you to look deeper and linger longer.
